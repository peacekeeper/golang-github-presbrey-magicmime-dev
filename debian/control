Description: Golang bindings for libmagic to detect mime-types.
 magicmime magicmime is a Go package which allows you to discover a file's
 mimetype by looking for magic numbers in its content. It could be used
 as a supplementary for Go's mime (http://golang.org/pkg/mime/) package
 which only interprets the file extension to detect mimetypes. Internally,
 it implements libmagic(3) (http://linux.die.net/man/3/libmagic) bindings.
 .
 Tested on Linux and Mac OS X, should be working on BSD. You could be able
 to build and make it working with Cygwin on Windows.  Usage In order to
 start, go get this repository: ~~~ go go get github.com/rakyll/magicmime
 ~~~ You may need to install devel packages for libmagic. On Debian,
 Ubuntu and CentOS, get libmagic-dev package from your package manager. On
 Mac OS X get libmagic via Homebrew: brew install libmagic. If you don't
 have the required dev packages, compilation will be terminated by an
 error saying magic.h cannot be found.
 .
 ~~~ go import "github.com/rakyll/magicmime" mm, err := magicmime.New()
 mimetype, err := mm.TypeByFile("/path/to/file") ~~~
 .
 Available functions are:
 .
 ~~~ go func (m *Magic) TypeByFile(filePath string) (string, error) func (m
 *Magic) TypeByBuffer(buffer []byte) (string, error) ~~~ LicenseCopyright
